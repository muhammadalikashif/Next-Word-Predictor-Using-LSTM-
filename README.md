# NLP Text Generation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on generating text sequences using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadalikashif/Next-Word-Predictor-Using-LSTM-
```

## Project Structure

- `GameofThrones.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the project code.

## Usage

1. Open the `GameofThrones.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to preprocess data, build the model, and train it.
3. Evaluate the model and generate text sequences.

## Model Details

- **Layers**: Embedding, LSTM, Dense
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss**: Categorical cross-entropy

## Results

The model generates text sequences based on the input data, demonstrating the ability of LSTM networks in NLP tasks.
